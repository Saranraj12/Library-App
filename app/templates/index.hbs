    <h4>A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display
        purposes. A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a
        physical
        location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical
        resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content
        held
        on bibliographic databases.<br><br>A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and
        maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a
        private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who
        are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting
        information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources</h4>
